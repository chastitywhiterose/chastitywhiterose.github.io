This file is an explanation of my new OpenGL programming project that I began on 12/31/2020.
The current name of the project is just "Chastity" because it's my name and I'll use it until I think of something better. Things can always be changed later. 

I started with copying from previous OpenGL programs I had written. I translated a lot that had previously used freeglut to using glfw instead because glfw allows the code to loop more linear than freeglut did. I had previous code samples to copy from the glfw version of my polygon program. But then I copied the font and text drawing code from my ftgl demo I made previously.

This gave me a working glfw program with text support on top of being able to do anything possible in OpenGL, limited only by my knowledge.

One of the main things I do with all my OpenGL programs is saving frames to files for later encoding into an animated gif or video. However, I was using a function that saved Windows BMP files. Because they are uncompressed and very large, this became an issue because my Pinebook Pro quickly ran out of space during a program designed to create enough frames for an hour. This caused the need to compress them into PNG files.

ImageMagick is totally capable of converting to PNG with several types of output. Below are useful commands for this purpose:

To convert while preserving all colors from original.
magick convert o/00000000.bmp o/00000000.png

Use RGB colorspace instead of the default srgb. For some reason this is smaller.
magick convert o/00000000.bmp -colorspace rgb o/00000000.png

To convert to output with only black and white. Usually smaller file.
magick convert o/00000000.bmp -monochrome o/00000000.png

To convert to grayscale
magick convert o/00000000.bmp -colorspace lineargray o/00000000.png

These are helpful guides I use when using ffmpeg to encode videos.

imagemagick raw conversion commands

To convert a bmp image to raw pixel data.

magick convert ./o/bbm.bmp ./o/bbm.mono
magick convert ./o/bbm.bmp ./o/bbm.gray
magick convert ./o/bbm.bmp ./o/bbm.rgb

To convert raw data back to original image. (using example 512x512 size for my test)

magick convert -size 512x512 ./o/bbm.mono ./o/bbm1.bmp
magick convert -depth 8 -size 512x512 ./o/bbm.gray ./o/bbm2.bmp
magick convert -depth 8 -size 512x512 ./o/bbm.rgb ./o/bbm3.bmp

Or to PNG format instead.

magick convert -size 512x512 ./o/bbm.mono ./o/bbm1.png
magick convert -depth 8 -size 512x512 ./o/bbm.gray ./o/bbm2.png
magick convert -depth 8 -size 512x512 ./o/bbm.rgb ./o/bbm3.png
