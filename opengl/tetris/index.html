<p>
Long Boi is a Tetris clone that I wrote which contains only the long block. Because of this, it's simpler to code than standard Tetris but at the same time is a complete game.

The source code files required to compile it are all available here:<br>

<a href="./main.c">main.c</a> <br>
<a href="./makefile">makefile</a> <br>
<a href="./chastity_tetris.h">chastity_tetris.h</a> <br>
<a href="./chastity_tetris_moves.h">chastity_tetris_moves.h</a> <br>

All graphics are done with the glfw library, legacy opengl, and ftgl for rendering the fonts. As such, it's no easy task to install all the required tools unless you're running Linux and have a package manager that can install them with a few commands. The makefile contains the commands required to compile on Linux or inside <a href="https://www.msys2.org/">msys2</a> running under Windows.

<p>
I have a <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!Aovs14QF6QY_o3RG0mzoQiRhuapU">Windows version</a> available to download as well. However most of the development was done on <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Linux</a> because it is a lot easier to compile C code.
