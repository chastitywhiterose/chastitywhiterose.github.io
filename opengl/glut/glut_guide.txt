Instructions for compiling and running my freeglut programs on Arch/Manjaro Linux

Because I use Manjaro Linux on the Pinebook Pro laptop, my package manager is pacman. These commands worked for me installing the needed tools.

sudo pacman -S gcc
sudo pacman -S freeglut
 
The reason I use Linux is exactly because things can be installed with simple commands like this. If however you're using Windows. I recommend msys2 because it also uses the pacman package manager and installs a usable Linux like terminal that I personally use when compiling my code on Windows.

There are minor differences between Windows and Linux for the gcc flags needed to compile things. However my makefile that I provide on this site has the commands that always worked for me!
