This project is my modern OpenGL experiment using GLEW as the extension loader. So far I have not seen any advantages to modern OpenGL using all these shaders and vertex buffers and arrays. I have been trying to learn it anyway just in case it turns out that I like it. I still prefer the fixed function pipeline though.

On Linux this can be compiled and run like this:

gcc -Wall -ansi -pedantic main.c -o main -lglfw -lOpenGL -lm -lGLEW && ./main

But when trying to compile on Windows within msys, a few modifications are needed.

gcc -Wall -ansi -pedantic main.c -o main -lglfw3 -lOpenGL32 -lm -lGLEW32 && ./main
