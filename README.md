Hello. This is my very first github project. I decided it was time to finally join github after hearing about it.

I also have a few sourceforge projects. My previous main project which stores the best of my code is:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/binary-bit-map/

My main area of computer programming is in graphics using the C Programming Language. I have achieved only a novice level when it comes to using toolkits like SDL, Allegro, freeglut, or glfw. But I have experiemented with all of them a little bit.

When it comes to writing basic text based software printing things to the terminal with printf, I'm rather advanced. I know the most important parts of the C standard library including use of pointers, dynamic memory management, and file input and output. I just have never organized my code well enough to present it officially in a way simple enough for people to understand. The C programming language is one of the best and all my attempts to learn other languages usually stop when I try to figure out why I am being told by books/tutorials that there are no pointers or that I have to make a whole class when all I want to do is print "Hello World"!

Until I get more of my code on github, you can look at the sourceforge project and email me at chastitywhiterose@gmail.com if you have questions about how it works or how to effectively compile and use it.
