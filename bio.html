<h1>Auto Biography of Chastity White Rose</h1>

<p>
My birth and legal name is Chandler Isaac Klebs. I have published books under that name and it's how most people know me. However I renamed myself Chastity White Rose in 2018 as a representation of my <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Vow-Chastity-White-Rose/dp/1709229926/">Vow of Chastity</a> and because of my transgender identity.
</p>

<p>
I was born May 15 1987 in Merriam Kansas USA. My mother is Judena Klebs who besides raising me as a single mother and homeschooling me is also a <a href="https://judykmusic.wordpress.com/">music teacher</a> and author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Horror-Hope-Judena-Klebs/dp/1682562565/">From Horror to Hope</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rejection-Love-Other-Poems-dp-1682562573/dp/1682562573/">From Rejection to Love</a>.

I was always very autistic and anti-social. I'm a genius in some ways but not good at human communication. I prefer computers and other species of animals. It's no surprise that I'm an ethical <a href="https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism">Vegan</a> and that this has formed most of my views on religion, philosophy, and politics.

To date I have only worked two different jobs in my adult life. The grocery store Hy-Vee and my current warehouse job in a federal facility that I dare not risk speaking about in detail but it's very physical! I do computer programming and digital art in what free time I get. I was also briefly in the Navy. That's why my mom still has the email address <a href="mailto:navyboymom@gmail.com">navyboymom@gmail.com</a>

If there is more you would like to know about me and how I grew up let me know and I can add it to this page. Or you could probably just ask my mom!
