<h1>Home Page of Chastity White Rose</h1>

<p>
Welcome to my website! It's nothing fancy right now but this site could have many purposes. I want to share my digital art and programming code and also my thoughts on <a href="./games/index.html">video games</a> and open source software in general.
</p>

<p>
Email me: 
<a href="mailto:chastitywhiterose@gmail.com">chastitywhiterose@gmail.com</a> 
 if you have any questions or suggestions for what I might do with this site.
</p>

<h1>Computer Programming Code</h1>

<p>
I know some <a href="./javascript/javascript.html">JavaScript</a> which allows drawing shapes directly to web pages with HTML canvas.
</p>

<p>
I have learned some very basic <a href="./opengl/opengl.html">OpenGL</a> and can now draw regular polygons to a window and even save them as a series of image files. I can combine various methods to make some types of animation.
</p>

<p>Although I have written various things in the C Programming Language, I have never organized them into something other people can understand and use. In fact that is one of the major goals of this website. It will allow me to get my code organized as I add it to this site and write tutorials for how to use it. My <a href="bbm/bbm.html">Binary Bit Map</a> project is one that I hope to explain how it works and why it's incredibly useful in making my style of animations, usually checkerboard related.

For now I recommend you check out the sourceforge project which hosts the majority of everything I have written related to computer graphics.

<h1>Non programming things I have written.</h1>

<p>
I have written books and many blog posts which are available but not very organized into one place. You can read my book 
<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Vow-Chastity-White-Rose/dp/1709229926/">The Vow of Chastity</a>
</p>

<p>
You may also enjoy my
<a href="https://chastitywhiterose.wordpress.com/">wordpress blog</a>
However it is very disorganized and contains a mix of my personal rants and programming discoveries.
</p>

<p>
You may also learn me about me by reading my small
<a href="./bio.html">autobiography</a>.
</p>


<p>Hopefully there will be more exciting content on this website in the future. It's only a matter of time collecting the best of the things I've done over the years.<p>
