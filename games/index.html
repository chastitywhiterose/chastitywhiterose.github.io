<h1>My favorite video games.</h1>

<p>
I have played many video games in my life and although there are thousands of games available, there are only a few games that REALLY stand out to me as being the ultimate experience for a player and providing infinite replay value that keeps you coming back for more things you haven't done yet. So I decided to create this list of the most addicting video games I have played and that you probably will like too.
</p>

<h1>Tetris</h1>

<p>
Tetris is officially the world's top selling video game of all time. That doesn't include the free clones of it which are impossible to track how many people download and play them. The list of official licensed Tetris games as well as my favorite free web versions are all worth playing. The game is simple. You have to fit the falling blocks together and clear as many lines as you can before the game gets too fast or until the time limit in Ultra or Blitz modes. Why it's so satisfying to play even after many years is a great mystery but I know personally I have constantly improved my high scores.

If you play Tetris, I highly recommend that you view my profiles on <a href="https://jstris.jezevec10.com/u/WhiteRose">Jstris</a> and <a href="https://ch.tetr.io/u/chastityrose">Tetr.io</a> We can play together if time allows or challenge each other's single player high scores.

<h1>Minecraft</h1>

<p>
Minecraft is undoubtedly one of the most played games of all time. Even those who have never played it have heard of Minecraft. This success is due mostly to the fact that the worlds are near infinite and you can place hundreds of different types of blocks which all have unique uses. It's blocky graphics and peaceful music make it look like it would be an easy child's game but there are a lot of achievements you can try to earn such as defeating the Ender Dragon or the Wither. The fact that the game has no story line nor does it push you in a specific direction means that you can play it any way you want to and make it as easy or hard as you want. There are playable versions that run under Java as well as the Bedrock Edition which is common to Windows 10, IOS, Android, and the Nintendo Switch! And friends playing on different machines can often play together just fine!

<h1>Stardew Valley</h1>

<img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/413150/header.jpg">

<p>
Stardew Valley is a farming game which is so much like the Harvest Moon series that you'll forget it was made by a different company. However it is also very much like playing Minecraft or Terraria because you can craft hundreds of items such as chests for extra storage, items to decorate your farm or house, and plenty of useful items which help you earn a little bit more money. It's just as good as any other farming game but it probably has more secret events and interactions with the characters than most farming games do.

<h1>Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town</h1>

<img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/978780/header.jpg">

<p>
Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town is a game in the style players will be familiar with in Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley. You have a farm to run as you please. I spend my time mostly growing and selling vegetables and making lots of money. But the game goes far beyond that. There are challenges, events, and you can even marry some of the town people. There are infinite ways to play and more secrets than can be uncovered in a lifetime. If you've played Stardew Valley you'll find this game is extremely close as far as what it lets you do. It originally was a Harvest Moon game for the Gameboy Advance and I used to own it. However the update allows you to play as either a boy or girl and also marry people of either sex. Allowing gay marriage is now a socially accepted thing and even the video games now show it.

<h1>Terraria</h1>

<img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/105600/header.jpg">

<p>
Terraria is a lot like Minecraft but is two dimensional. However it has a lot of different bosses to fight and a much better soundtrack. There are a lot of things to do but there is also sort of a linear progression in that you must complete certain tasks before others. It's no less addicting but it may be easier on your computer than Minecraft due to less use of intense graphics and limited world size. However you can create multiple worlds and even move your character and the items they are holding freely between your worlds.

<h1>Pokemon Sword and Shield</h1>

<img src="https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/video-games/video-games/pokemon_sword_shield/pokemon-sword-shield-visit-the-site-en.jpg">

<p>
I have played Pokemon games since the original Red, Blue, and Yellow versions were released. However I do not feel that the series reached close to the same status of greatness as the other games on this page until the release of the expansion pass in Sword and/or Shield. This is because the new legendary horses were added. The Ghost type Spectrier and the Ice type Glastrier.
</p>

<p>
Before the addition of these legendary horses, I found it impossible to create the horse team that I wanted. My greatest criticism of the Pokemon series is that although there are so many cats and dogs, there are still at this time very few horses. There is only Ponyta,Rapidash,Mudbray,Mudsdale,Blitzle,Zebstrika,Keldeo,Spectrier, and Glastrier. However what makes those final two so special is that they are the first horses strong enough to actually be used seriously in battle. Rapidash is awesome but it's far too weak and will not survive a hit when seriously trying to battle against friends or others online in ranked battles. Now at least I have a team that can win half the time. I've always been one to use the Pokemon that I liked best rather than whatever is the strongest or used the most competitively. But now thanks to Sword and Shield, that has all changed. That is why these are my favorite of all the Pokemon games.
