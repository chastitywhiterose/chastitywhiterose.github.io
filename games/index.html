<h1>My favorite video games.</h1>

<p>
I have played many video games in my life and although there are thousands of games available, there are only a few games that REALLY stand out to me as being the ultimate experience for a player and providing infinite replay value that keeps you coming back for more things you haven't done yet. So I decided to create this list of the most addicting video games I have played and that you probably will like too.
</p>

<h1>Minecraft</h1>

<p>
Minecraft is undoubtedly one of the most played games of all time. Even those who have never played it have heard of Minecraft. This success is due mostly to the fact that the worlds are near infinite and you can place hundreds of different types of blocks which all have unique uses. It's blocky graphics and peaceful music make it look like it would be an easy child's game but there are a lot of achievements you can try to earn such as defeating the Ender Dragon or the Wither. The fact that the game has no story line nor does it push you in a specific direction means that you can play it any way you want to and make it as easy or hard as you want. There are playable versions that run under Java as well as the Bedrock Edition which is common to Windows 10, IOS, Android, and the Nintendo Switch! And friends playing on different machines can often play together just fine!

<h1>Stardew Valley</h1>

<p>
Stardew Valley is a farming game which is so much like the Harvest Moon series that you'll forget it was made by a different company. However it is also very much like playing Minecraft or Terraria because you can craft hundreds of items such as chests for extra storage, items to decorate your farm or house, and plenty of useful items which help you earn a little bit more money. It's just as good as any other farming game but it probably has more secret events and interactions with the characters than most farming games do.

<h1>Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town</h1>

<p>
Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town is a game in the style players will be familiar with in Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley. You have a farm to run as you please. I spend my time mostly growing and selling vegetables and making lots of money. But the game goes far beyond that. There are challenges, events, and you can even marry some of the town people. There are infinite ways to play and more secrets than can be uncovered in a lifetime. If you've played Stardew Valley you'll find this game is extremely close as far as what it lets you do. It originally was a Harvest Moon game for the Gameboy Advance and I used to own it. However the update allows you to play as either a boy or girl and also marry people of either sex. Allowing gay marriage is now a socially accepted thing and even the video games now show it.

<h1>Terraria</h1>

<p>
Terraria is a lot like Minecraft but is two dimensional. However it has a lot of different bosses to fight and a much better soundtrack. There are a lot of things to do but there is also sort of a linear progression in that you must complete certain tasks before others. It's no less addicting but it may be easier on your computer than Minecraft due to less use of intense graphics and limited world size. However you can create multiple worlds and even move your character and the items they are holding freely between your worlds.
